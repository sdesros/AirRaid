# AirRaid-VIC-20
A game written in BASIC for the unexpected VIC-20.

# About the game
Originally written around 1987 in BASIC and inspired by Sega's Afterburner. The game uses the "tab" function in print in order to display large elements quickly as opposed to when I would have used "peeks" and "pokes".

# Instructions
* Use the Joystick to move the plane on top of the screen left and right.
* Use the firebutton to launch a bomb.
* Try and destroy as many of the 10 fuel depots by bombing them when they are right under your plane.

# How to build
This repository includes a project in [CBM Prg Studio](http://www.ajordison.co.uk/) a windows IDE for various Commodore 8 bit computers.

# How to run
Either build or download the .prg file to run in an emulator or load into a real VIC-20 via SDIEC or other means.
